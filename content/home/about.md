It started with a YouTube video where Corey Goode was interviews by David Wilcock. From David Wolcock, i found The Law of One(Ra Material) by L/L Research and started listen to the audio books.

The next sets of book i found was The Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life by Drunvalo Melchizedek. Then i found Dolores Cannon on YouTube and started listen to her audio books, The Legend of Starcrash, The Three Waves of Volunteer, Conversations with Nostradamus, The Convoluted Universe, The Search for Hidden Sacred Knowledge and The Custodians.

From Dolores Cannon YouTube, I found Alba Weinman YouTube then Pamela Aaralyn YouTube then Rising Phoenix Aurora YouTube and others

There are a lots of books and videos about this subject but which one do i belive in ? The reason this is real for me is because of the 2 sets of books which is The Law of One and The Convoluted Universe. Both books where writen by different people at different time and from channeled by different being yet both books provides the same informations, informations that is not easily available.

I remember when i was at primary school and i was fascinated by the bermuda triangle so i went to my school's libary and i found a book about it but when i flip through the pages the information in the book has nothing more than what was already known.

During the time when The Matrix movie release, i found a small printed books about quantum physic at my tuition's house so i started reading. What strike me was the scene where Neo went to visit the Oracle and saw the kid bending the spoon. What i remember in the quantum physic book was wornhole, spoon bending and an object(chair) appear and disappear. Those are the memories that i remember and it lead me to this.
