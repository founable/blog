# About

It started with a YouTube video where Corey Goode was interviews by David Wilcock. From David Wolcock, i found The Law of One(Ra Material) by L/L Research and start listen to the audio book. It was hard to comprehence since it is so new to me but i managed to finish all 5 books with average understanding.

The next sets of book i found was The Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life by Drunvalo Melchizedek. Then i found Dolores Cannon on YouTube and start listen to her audio books, The Legend of Starcrash, The Three Waves of Volunteer, Conversations with Nostradamus, The Convoluted Universe, The Search for Hidden Sacred Knowledge and The Custodians.

From Dolores Cannon YouTube, I found Alba Weinman YouTube then Pamela Aaralyn YouTube then Rising Phoenix Aurora YouTube. All this people was mention in Dolores Cannon book without names which was a good moment for me when i was able to connect the dots.

There are a lots of books and videos about this subject but which one is telling the truth ? It is hard to believe it when i was not born with this information, school do not teach and family never talks about it. The reason this is real for me is because of 2 set of books which is The Law of One and The Convoluted Universe. Both book where writen by different people at differebt year Both books are message from channeling by different being but yet they provide the same information, informations that i would not able to find in the public library.

I remember when i was at primary school and i was fascinated by the bermuda triangle so i went to my school libary and i found a book about it but when i flip throught it, the information in the book has nothing more than what was already known.

The Matrix movie came out and during that time , i found a small printed books about quantum physic at my tuition's house so i started reading. What strike me was the scene where Neo wen to visit the Oracle and saw the kid bending the spoon. What i remember in the quantum physic book was wornhole, bending spoon and an object(chair) appear and disappear. Those are the memories that i remember and it lead me to this.
