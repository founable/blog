The full moon is in the start sign of Sagittarius! The moon in sagittarius brings a time of investigation, pursuit, and spontaneity. People may feel bolder, amicable, and fun loving. It is a good time for exploring happiness and philosophies, as well as supplementing the mind. Like the Archer that represents Sagittatius, people may have a tendency toward seeking out truth and higher consequences, following intuition, as well as flights of fancy.

While the loging for independence will be spirited, people may want to do what they want, when they want, and be impulsive or progressive. These biases can cause irritation and a strong need for freedom.

The moon in Sagittatius is very faithful with her feeling. She is smart and ethical in thoughtful situition; considering others with admiration, empathy, and a sense of humor. She believes in telling it like it is, even if the truth hurts. Sagittarius moon needs for others to be truthful with her as well. She is deeply injured by deceit. she has a talent for coaching others, and yet a fevent student. Every emotional incident is an opportunity for her to engage and help others with the information she has expanded upon.

- Make love of life: Whether this means literally making love with intentional celebration of your creative forces and pleasure, or metaphorically, this is time to put your hearts desires into motion. Dance. Paint. Sing. Play music. Weave. Craft.
- Vision Board: Take action to bring all your sacred visions to form with a vision board and place it under the moon light for blessed activation.
- Fire moon ritual: Get into nature. Take off your shoes. Breathe in the air and remember that your cycles mimic hers. Give any your limiting beliefs and fears to the fire(either by building one or with candles). With movement and voice, write them down and burn them. This is an act of purification and activation and a releasing of any heavy weight or burdens you may be carrying. Then welcome in and all the feeling inside of you that make you feel wonderful and move in that direction. Literally.
- Moon Elixir: Coombine mint/rose/tulsi/hibiscus/cinnamon tea with honey and you've a simple and delicious fiery elixir. Place it in Full Moon light(you can even add a quartz crystal into your cup for added magic), frink in all that you are great-full for and sip in celebration of your feminine lunar essence.
- Remember: Put out gem stones and jewels in a window or in water for cleasing, renewal and activation. Place an apple and glass of water in the moonlight and have it for a 'Moon Wisdom' breakfast the next morning.
- Commune: Gather in an intenrional way with loved ones and do any of the above together and create your own. Now can be powerful time to be with the energy of the collective.
