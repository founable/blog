### Function
Throat chakra is known as the purification center, it is associated with higher discrimination and is associated with creativity and self-expression. It is believed that when throat chakra is closed, a person undergoes decay and death. When it is open, negative experiences are transformed into wisdom and learning. The success and failure in one's life are said to depend upon the state of this chakra, whether it is polluted or clean. The feeling of being guilty is given as the most prominent reason for this to block the Kundalini energy moving upwards. It is associated with the element Akasha, or Ether, and the sense of hearing, as well as the action of speaking.

Meditation upon this chakra is said to bring about various siddhis or occult powers: vision of the three periods, past, present and future; freedom from disease and old age; destruction of dangers; and the ability to move the three worlds.
