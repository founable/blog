# Mother Mary Queen of Angels

Mary is sometimes referred to as the Queen of Angels. That is partly because she's has so many interractions with angels: Her own birth was predicted by angels, and Archhangel Gabriel personally gave Mary the news that she was destined to be the mother of Jesus. But more than that, Mary has much in common with the angels. Mary is an ideal divine entity to call upon if there is a situition you need t osurrender to. Mary understands as well as anyone the many challenges, lessons and limitations of earthly life, so Mary will often enter our lives when we need someone to stand beside us duringour trails. Angels offer their support whether you ask for it or not, and MAry will often pick folks who are walking a difficult path and walk beside them regardless of wheather she has been formally called upon. Mary's vast knowledge of both eartly life and the Divine make her the ideal confidant and counselor. If you're looking for good advice about how to handle an aspect of your eartly journey, or want insight into Spirit's plan for your life, ask angels for guidance. But you can also ask Mary. Both the angels and MAry have a close relationship with spirit. Pray to Mary and the angels when you need someone to advocate for you with the Divine, Because Mary and the angels have an inside track. Angels are thenderhearted, and Mary is likewise very compassionate. That means Mary will work earnestly to plead your case with Spirit and alert the appropriate angels, archangels, spirit guides and asvended masters you your plight. In this way Mary can bring more grace and mervy into your life. she might even call on her son, Jesus, to help you! Beside sending amazing people and opportunities into your life, and giving you ideas and gut instincts about which action steps to take, angels love to send you celestial energy. This engelic energy is very calming, joyful and loving, and can help shift or soften your own energy. Mary's energy is also quite powerful and, life the angel's energy, is very maternal. People usually think of all the ways angels are different from humans, but in many importan aspect angels and humans are extremely similar. Angels have hearts and souls just like we do, and feel emotions -- theirs and ours -- deeply. It is Mary sensitivity which like that of the angels, inspires her to help so many. You can never alienate an angel. They won't turn their wings on you no matter what you do, no matter what the circumstances. The same is true of Mary. If you're feeling abandoned or like someone you care for is judging you or being very conditional with their affection, turn to Mary for some guaranteed TLC. Hopefully reading about Mary's angelic nature will encourage you to call on her for assistance, just like you call upon your angels!
