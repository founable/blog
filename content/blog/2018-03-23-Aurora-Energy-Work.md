## Online Akashi Reading/Energy Work with Aurora

I needed some spiritual guidance during this times when i was lost in life, it was a wonderfull session where i get answer for some very deep question that i have and i need some confirmation of what is that and what i need to do. 

## Lesson

Learn to speak my truth with compassion
Learn to speak my heart with compassion
Learn to speak my mind with compassion

## Choice

I have the free will to choose to learn my lesson and be done with it or repeat it again. I prefer to learn my lesson and not repeat in another life to learn it again
