# Clairaudience - Confirmation

I had my first strong clearaudiance confirmation during working with angels classes where i had multiple people that i can confirm with.

During working with angels classes , we learn different angels then we perform a short meditation to meet the angels.

Next is the healing by Rosa Garcia, she and Estela were amazing, I learn so much from them and the most important part was I learn to trust my self and the hints that my guide gave me. We are all humans and sometimes I need confirmation and they help me.

I was the first person on the chair where Rosa start working on me. Before the healing , Estella said i have a cloud above my head and it is in disguise.

While i was on the chair, I felt strong energy on my body and i start vibrate front and back on the chair. Rosa pauses and looking for feather (tools to help clearing the energy). I happen to bring a shungite wand with me. While she help me clear this cloud energy, I started vibrate stronger and the strogest energy were behind my head just above my neck and that energy pushes Rosa back further. During the clearing, she sprinkle holy water around me to help with the clearing. Buddha, Mother Mary and Archengel Michael was there to help. 

Estella told me to compress this strong energy so I start to use my hand to create a sphere and compress this energy from my body and my head to this sphere that i am forming with my hand in front of me. Almost at the end, i hear a Estella said "Jack, you can relax and let go of your hand" so i just let go of my hand then Estella said something about why I let it go and i told her that she told me to let go but she did not said that. Dina also hear the voice and she look at Estella and Rosa and their lips were not moving.

At that moment, I realize that I am clairaudience and I am able to hear voices not from this third vibratory density.
