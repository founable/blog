This is my first time attending shamanic journey. It was in a almost look like a dance studio with nice wooded floor without mirror. It is a multi-purpose space where there was a group of people doing yogo before we start our journey.

we arrange a huge circle with elders with drums sits on the North South East West of the circle and in the center, there are 4 candle and we place our belonging that we want to be part of the journey.

some of us sits and some of us lay down with head facing the center. we start with flute then drums.

During my journey, i saw many different scene of of people interacting and communicating with each other in my mind's eye. At one point i was traveling throught space and zip through sphere object(my guess is planet) one at a time. The rest of my journey just in peace.

At the end of the journey , many people share their experience.
