5. I assume you already have GitHub account and SSH key setup or else go to [GitHub - Generating a new SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)

6. Create another repo with name same as your domain name but with a different extension so we can identify the folder name (example: founadle.md). This will be the repo for the markdown file.

8. Create a repo with name same as your domain name (example: founable.com). This will be the repo for the end product. Files that was generated by HUGO using `hugo -d ./founable.com`
