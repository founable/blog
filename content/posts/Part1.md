This is a static sites generated via [HUGO](https://gohugo.io). It is hosted in GitHub with GitHub Page and domain by Google. Everything is free except domain name.

If you are looking to secure your sites with a certs HTTPS(SSL), you want to look into Google Cloud or Amazon AWS solution

Tools:

- Computer/Laptop (I use both Windows & MacOS)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (Mac)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (my go to for text editor)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com)

# MacOS
1. Install Homebrew from Terminal, you will need to be Admin and have password to install.
`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

2. Install Git via Homebrew from Terminal.
`brew install git`

3. Install HUGO via Homebrew from Terminal.
`brew install hugo`

4. Inatall Visual Studio Code via Homebrew from Terminal.
` brew install visual-studio-code`


5. I assume you already have GitHub account and SSH key setup or else go to [GitHub - Generating a new SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)

6. Create another repo with name same as your domain name but with a different extension so we can identify the folder name (example: founadle.md). This will be the repo for the markdown file.

8. Create a repo with name same as your domain name (example: founable.com). This will be the repo for the end product. Files that was generated by HUGO using `hugo -d ./founable.com`
